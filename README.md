## ℹ️ About

**The Lobby** is a destructible map for Garry's Mod where you can destroy nearly everything — including props.  
Destruction is inspired by the **Digital Molecular Matter (DMM)** physics engine.

Originally created in 2010 by [robixn][robixn_showcase_physlobby].

For the best experience, it is recommended to use:
- Garry's Mod version: **Chromium x64**
- Physics engine: **VPhysics Jolt**

**Map name:** `phys_lobby`  
**Bind for map reset:** `bind <key> gmod_admin_cleanup`  
*Example:* `bind del gmod_admin_cleanup`  
You can also type `gmod_admin_cleanup` in the console.

## 📦 Installation

### Method 1 — Steam Workshop

- Subscribe to the map on [Steam Workshop][steam_workshop].

### Method 2 — Manual installation

1. [Download the map archive][download_latest_map]
2. Extract the `phys_lobby` folder into the `addons` directory

## ⚙️ Performance Recommendations

### Enabling Chromium x64

If you're using a licensed copy of Garry's Mod:

**Steam:**  
`Garry's Mod → Properties → Betas → x86-64 - Chromium + 64-bit binaries`

**Why?**  
To support the improved physics engine **VPhysics Jolt**

### Installing VPhysics Jolt

1. [Download the ZIP archive here][vphysics_gmod_build]
2. Extract it to your Garry's Mod installation folder:  
   `..\steamapps\common\GarrysMod`

> ⚠️ If you're using a pirated copy, expect performance issues.
