## Information

The Lobby is a destructible map for Garry's Mod. You have the ability to destroy absolutely everything, right down to the props.  
Destructibility is simulated by a physics engine called Digital Molecular Matter, aka DMM.

The map was originally created by [robixn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7MYttLnHpA) in 2010 year.

For a comfortable game we recommend the Chromium x64 version of the game along with the installed enhanced physics engine VPhysics Jolt.

Map name: phys_lobby  
Bind to restore: bind `<key>` gmod_admin_cleanup  
For example i used "Delete" key  
You can also simply type gmod_admin_cleanup in the console

## Installation

+ Download the [latest map version](https://github.com/boxden/The-Lobby/releases/download/phys_lobby/the_lobby_2886996246.7z)

+ Drag&Drop the "phys_lobby" into "addons" folder

### Recommendation for better performance

If you have a licensed version of Garry's Mod, switch to the beta branch named "x86-64 - Chromium + 64-bit binaries"  
(Garry's Mod -> Properties -> Beta Versions -> "x86-64 - Chromium + 64-bit binaries")

Q: What's that for?  
A: To support the improved physics engine "VPhysics Jolt"

### VPhysics-Jolt Installation

+ Download the required version of the engine from [this link](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/VPhysics-Jolt/releases/)
+ Extract the downloaded archive into folder "bin" in Garry's Mod game directory

If you have a non-licensed version of the game, you will have to suffer lags
